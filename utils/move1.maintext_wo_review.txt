Abstract  
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the application of AI in 
academic research and language education has become increasingly widespread. GPT-4o, a 
new flagship model that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time, has been found 
to offer substantial improvements over its predecessors. However, its capability to analyse 
rhetorical moves in creative writing remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether 
GPT-4o can identify the rhetorical moves in narrative short stories with a focus on language 
assessment themes, and check the accuracy of the results by human experts. Moreover, the 
essentiality and frequency of the moves in these stories are reported. Adopting Jiang et al.’s 
(2024) eight-move model for the annotation of narrative stories, the results indicated that while 
ChatGPT (GPT-4o) quickly identified rhetorical moves, its segmentation of sentence endpoints 
differed slightly from human coders, particularly in several moves. However, these differences 
did not affect the overall range, frequency, or sequence of the moves, suggesting that GPT-4o 
can still effectively identify moves in narrative short stories. Another finding showed that 
Moves 1 to 6 were obligatory in all 50 narrative short stories from Tests & Us (Volumes 2 & 
3), while Moves 7 and 8 were conventional, with no optional moves identified. As for the 
occurrence frequency, these stories contain 478 moves, with Move 4, “Complicating the story” 
being the most frequent, appearing 80 times (16.7%). These findings offer insights into the 
potential of AI to support textual analysis in creative writing and encourage researchers to 
explore rhetorical moves in narratives.

Introduction  
Narrative short stories are a vital literary genre that recounts connected events or actions within 
a specific timeframe, often following a chronological and causally related structure (Yoon, 
2021). Beyond storytelling, narratives are fundamental to language acquisition and literacy 
development, helping individuals articulate thoughts, construct self-identity, and build social 
relationships (Deane et al., 2019). Moreover, they can shed light on the competency of 
narrators’ language and their pragmatic knowledge, and therefore, they can be of great 
importance for pedagogical and artistic purposes (Kang, 2005). In terms of narrative structure, 
the orientation, complication, evaluation, and resolution phases are present in it and there may 
be a coda as well (Labov & Waletzky, 1967). These stages guide the reader through the story, 
offering deeper understanding and engagement.  
As artificial intelligence (AI) has matured, with an emphasis on natural language processing,
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
many researchers are interested in the potential of applying AI models to the examination of 
creative writing processes. Cognitive analysis involves the detection of patterns and structures 
in various domains using tools, where GPT-4o, which synthesizes not only text but also audio 
and video data based on advanced technologies, has been highly performed in text and 
structural analysis of scholarly and technical writings. However, analysis of narrative fiction, 
particularly short stories, is a more complex task, whose exploration is still in its fledgling 
stages. Specifically, whether GPT-4o can accurately identify rhetorical moves—key stages in 
a story’s development—has not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study is to fill this gap by looking into whether GPT-4o can effectively perform rhetorical move 
analysis in narrative short stories. 
Applying Jiang et al.’s (2024) eight-move model for annotation, this research will compare 
GPT-4o’s performance with that of human coders, focusing on accuracy in identifying move 
structures. The analysis will also assess the essentiality and frequency of these moves within 
50 short stories from Tests & Us (Volumes 2 & 3). By examining GPT-4o’s capabilities in 
analysing creative writing, this research aims to contribute to the growing discourse on the role 
of AI in language education and literary analysis. Understanding whether AI can replicate the 
nuanced analytical skills of human experts in narrative writing will provide insights into its 
potential applications in both academic research and educational tools. 
The findings highlight the potential of AI models in supporting complex forms of text analysis, 
particularly in reducing the time and expertise required for manual coding. However, despite 
this progress, there has been limited attention given to how the latest model, GPT-4o, performs 
in rhetorical move analysis, especially within creative narratives. This study aims to address 
this gap by examining GPT-4o’s performance in this area. Firstly, the study investigates the 
extent to which GPT-4o can identify and analyse rhetorical moves in narrative short stories 
with a focus on language assessment themes. Secondly, the study explores the essentiality rates 
and occurrence frequency of the moves in these short stories. 
 
Literature Review 
Narrative short stories, a staple of literary fiction, captivate readers by weaving together plot, 
character, setting, and theme in compact and compelling ways. These stories often employ a 
variety of rhetorical techniques to engage, inform, and evoke emotions, creating a nuanced 
interplay between form and function. Whether they are exploring human emotions or depicting 
fantastical worlds, narrative short stories offer rich material for analysis, especially when it 
comes to identifying the communicative strategies authors use to convey meaning. One such 
method of analysis is rhetorical move analysis, which breaks down a text into schematic units 
or “moves”, each serving a distinct communicative function within the broader discourse. A 
move is seen as a chunk of text, encompassing at least one complete sentence with a specific 
communicative function, indicating that any sentence or group of sentences meeting the criteria 
of a move or step in the coding system was considered an instance of that move or step, 
irrespective of length (Zhang & Wannaruk, 2016; Geng et al., 2023). In the coding phase, 
moves or steps are counted as single instances if uninterrupted, but as separate instances if 
interrupted by different moves or steps (Geng et al., 2023). This type of analysis has 
traditionally been done manually, a time-consuming process that requires deep expertise in 
both linguistics and the genre being studied. Though manual move analysis is considered the 
gold standard, tools such as Mover, Research Writing Tutor, and Academic Writing Analytics 
(AWA) have emerged to assist researchers in identifying rhetorical structures more efficiently 
(Knight et al., 2020). These tools offer varying degrees of automation, but they still rely heavily 
on human input for accurate coding and interpretation.

Released on May 13, 2024, GPT-4o (“o” for “Omni”, derived from the Latin word “omnis”, 
meaning “all” or “every”) is the latest multimodal LLM (Large Language Model) from 
OpenAI. It provides significant enhancements on its predecessors with the addition of 
multimodal features, larger context windows, advanced tokenization, and higher processing 
speeds, and, the performance state of the arts in generation and comprehension over texts, 
audio, images, and video. It is also a step towards much more natural human-computer 
interaction (Islam & Moushi, 2024). It has the ability to respond to audio inputs in 232 
milliseconds on the minimum and a little over 320 milliseconds on an average, which is rather 
efficient in conversation. It also delivers performance on par with GPT-4 Turbo in terms of 
processing text in English and code and demonstrates further breakthroughs in producing text 
in other languages, but it is vastly quicker and costs half as much in the API. The model’s 
efficiency in handling different types of data results in high success rates and reduced 
processing times and costs (OpenAI, 2024). Thus, Geng et al. (2024) considered if there is a 
possibility of employing AI to conduct other various types of textual analysis including 
discourse, sentiment, and stylistic analysis, as well as for linguistic analysis encompassing 
lexical, semantic, pragmatic, genre, frame, and intertextuality analysis.  
Based on previous findings, scholars have already begun exploring GPT-4 and GPT-4o’s 
capabilities in automating elements of textual analysis. For example, Savelka et al. (2023) 
demonstrated that GPT-4 can analyse legal texts at a level comparable to trained law students. 
Similarly, Siiman (2023) found that GPT-4 could assist in qualitative data analysis when 
properly guided by structured prompts, aligning AI outputs closely with human interpretations. 
Geng & Nimehchisalem (2023) noticed that GPT-4 could conduct conceptual metaphors and 
thematic analysis of short stories. Lian (2024) investigated GPT-4o in fields such as medical 
education, where it outperformed previous models by achieving accuracy levels above the 
national pass mark in the 2023 Chinese Medical Licensing Examination.  However, while these 
studies have demonstrated its potential in structured disciplines, its application to creative and 
narrative-based textual analysis remains largely unexplored.  
 
Methods 
Research Design 
The current study used a mixed approach that integrated qualitative and quantitative methods 
to obtain the benefits from both approaches. The qualitative aspect involved human coders 
verifying the moves identified by the AI-assisted tool GPT-4o. Meanwhile, the quantitative 
aspect aimed to determine the essentiality rates and frequency of occurrence of rhetorical 
moves within the constructed corpus. 
Corpus Construction 
In this study, 50 narrative short stories were selected from the books Tests & Us – A Collection 
of Real Stories (Volumes 2 and 3) (Nimehchisalem & Geng, 2023; Nimehchisalem & Geng, 
2024), published by Generis Publishing. Volume 2 contains 22 stories, while Volume 3 
contains 28 stories. These stories were chosen because they collectively provide a diverse and 
representative corpus, featuring narratives written by students, teachers, researchers, educators, 
and professional writers from different parts of the world. With various backgrounds 
originating from diverse countries and nurtured among different linguistic environments, these 
writers have not only brought their cultural perspectives but also given new insights on 
“assessment” to make it more thrilling for readers. To enable comprehensive examination by 
GPT-4o and language specialists, the accessible stories were collated into a single Word file. 
Table 1 presents the word counts of short stories in these two collections.

It can be seen from the table that the total word count is around 53,693, with an average of 
1,074 words per short story. The briefest narrative, titled “The Power of Hard Work”, consists 
of 490 words, whereas the lengthiest story, entitled “Bridging Worlds: The Odyssey of 
Hammurabi”, encompasses 2,091 words. 
Analytical Framework  
The current research analysed the use of rhetorical moves in 50 narrative short stories of 
language assessment by employing Jiang et al.’s (2024) pioneering eight-move model. This 
framework (as can been seen in Table 2) consisted of three stages, namely, Orientation, 
Incident, and Conclusion, which were further categorized into eight moves.

The first stage, Orientation, sets up the context and “presents an expectant activity sequence” 
for the narrative (Martin & Rose, 2008, p. 51). Three moves are involved in this stage. Move 
1, Setting the scene, introduces the story’s characters, time, location, and behavioural situation. 
Move 2, Laying out the event, presents a temporal sequence of occurrences at the beginning of 
the text, explaining how one event leads to another while expounding on the context and 
acquainting readers with the story’s setting to promote plot development. Move 3, Giving the 
current situation, outlines the temporary state within the story before the plot complication 
arises. This move helps readers understand the overall atmosphere and mood, setting the stage 
for the following section. 
The second stage, known as the Incident, introduces the central event of the story and marks a 
significant progression in the plot. Three moves are comprised in this stage. Move 4, 
Complicating the story, unfolds temporally ordered actions that break the normalcy established 
in the first stage and that lead to one or more conflicts in the story. Move 5, Evaluating the 
status quo, assesses the complication by expressing attitudes or opinions about it. This 
evaluation often “suspends the action, increasing the narrative tension, and intensifying the 
release when tension is resolved” (Martin & Rose, 2008, p. 52). Move 6, Dealing with the 
complication, addresses and resolves the crisis introduced in Move 4. 
The third stage, the Conclusion, wraps up the narrative by summarizing its essence and guiding 
readers back to the ‘reality’ of the present. This stage includes two moves. Move 7, 
Foregrounding the main idea, highlights the central theme following the resolution, either 
implicitly through a climactic event or explicitly by emphasizing the story’s moral. Move 8, 
Ending the story, provides a final statement or reflection on the narrative, either returning to 
the present moment or offering a new context unrelated to the main event, thus bringing the 
story to a close.  
Data Analysis 
In this study, an AI-assisted tool was employed for qualitative analysis of rhetorical moves 
within creative writing, specifically for narrative short stories. To address the first research 
question, a most recent cutting-edge version of ChatGPT (GPT-4o) was used to identify the 
moves in 50 narratives from Tests & Us – A Collection of Real Stories (Volumes 2 & 3). The 
interaction with GPT-4o commenced with the researchers initiating a “new chat” and inputting 
specific prompts and cues. 
Firstly, Jiang et al.’s (2024) pioneering eight-move model for the annotation of narrative stories 
was inserted into the chat interface in detail, serving as the instruction set for the AI program. 
Subsequently, GPT-4o was tasked with performing the analysis based on the provided 
requirements. As observed by Geng et al. (2024), the accuracy of the results generated by 
ChatGPT was directly proportional to the precision and clarity of the instructions and 
questions. The AI system provided more accurate and dependable results when it received lucid 
and explicit directives. Hence, the researchers tried to add some instructions on how to code 
chunks of text and underline the typical parts that realize certain moves.
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
The prompt entered to GPT-4o was like:  
- The contents of Jiang et al.’ s (2024) eight-move model. 
- A rhetorical move is characterized as a chunk of text that contains at least one complete 
sentence and serves a specific communicative function. This means that whenever a 
sentence or combination of sentences fits the description of any move in the coding 
system, it is regarded to be an instance of a move regardless of its length. 
- By adopting Jiang et al.’s (2024) eight-move model, could you please tag chunks of text 
as No. 1, 2, 3, mention the start and end point of each chunk, underline the typical parts 
that realize each move, add a short description, and create a table by thoroughly 
analysing all the moves in the following narrative short story, with special attention to 
recurring ones that contribute to the cyclical progression of the narrative? The columns 
of the table should be: Move No., Functions, Start & End Points, and Descriptions. 
By clicking “send message” to deliver the prompt, GPT-4o would answer by generating a table 
with the requested information. Due to the cyclical repetition feature of moves (Swales, 2004), 
the researcher delivered another prompt - Does the analysis include all the recurring moves? 
to make the results more accurate by avoiding the missing of any recurring moves.   
After obtaining the results for the identification of moves in 50 narrative short stories, the 
potential errors that GPT-4o made in the analysis were examined by two human coders. If any 
discrepancies arose, the researcher conducted a deeper investigation to determine the 
underlying causes. 
Finally, the essentiality and frequency of the moves in these stories were analysed manually. 
Essentiality is about the covering range of moves and refers to the percentage of texts that 
contain a certain move at least once (Lu et al., 2021) while frequency is about the number of 
moves and refers to the occurrence of a certain move in all the texts of a corpus. Regarding 
essentiality rates or inclusion rates, this study followed Rasmeenin’s (2006) rationale by 
defining a move as obligatory if it appeared in 100% of the analysed corpus, conventional if it 
occurred in 66% to 99% of the corpus, and optional if it was present in less than 66%. As for 
occurrence frequency, this study used descriptive statistics and the auxiliary software SPSS to 
report the distribution (percentage) of each move. A point worthy of mention is that the cyclical 
repetition of a move within a section of text was addressed by treating each occurrence of the 
move as separate. For instance, if a text begins with Move 1, proceeds to Move 2, and then 
returns to Move 1, Move 1 would be counted twice (Biber et al., 2007).  
 
Results and Discussion  
GPT-4o’s Capacity of the Identification of Moves in Narrative Short Stories  
According to the findings, the researcher discovered that ChatGPT (GPT-4o) was able to 
quickly and accurately identify rhetorical moves. However, regarding the chunks of text 
segmented by GPT-4o, the sentence endpoints were coded differently by GPT-4o and human 
coders. This discrepancy can be observed in several moves, such as M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, and 
M7.  
While the analysis includes 50 narrative short stories with a language assessment theme, Table 
3 presents an example of GPT-4o’s identification of moves within a story titled “Assessment 
in My Little Heaven, Primary One” written by Jayakaran Mukundan. The story recounts his 
childhood experiences as the eighth child in a large family, along with his struggles with 
dyslexia and health issues. Despite these challenges, his Standard One teacher, Ms. Ong Siok
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
Lay, who lacked formal university training but employed a caring teaching approach, helped 
him overcome these difficulties. Ms. Ong used songs, dramatization, and positive 
reinforcement to create an inclusive and encouraging classroom environment. Jayakaran’s 
traditional writing difficulties were mitigated by his strong artistic abilities; he was even praised 
for his creative drawings, despite often inverting letters. Ms. Ong’s patient and supportive 
approach made Jayakaran feel valued and capable. Unfortunately, her departure at the end of 
the year marked the end of this nurturing period, as subsequent teachers did not offer the same 
level of understanding or support. The story underscores the profound impact of compassionate 
teaching and highlights the importance of recognizing and nurturing each child’s unique 
abilities, demonstrating how tailored educational strategies can significantly enhance a 
student’s learning journey and self-esteem.

return to his previous 
challenges. 
From the analysis in Table 3, it is evident that all eight moves were detected by GPT-4o. The 
sequence of moves was identified as M1-M2-M3-M4-M5-M6-M4-M6-M4-M6-M7-M8. GPT-
4o accurately labelled the move functions corresponding to their respective move numbers. 
Notably, M4 (Complicating the story) and M6 (Dealing with the complication) occurred three 
times each, reflecting their cyclical repetition within the narrative. In contrast, the other moves 
each appeared only once.
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
However, when comparing GPT-4o’s coding results with those of human coders, discrepancies 
were found in the endpoint for M7 (Foregrounding the main idea) and the starting point for M8 
(Ending the story). The last paragraph of the story reads:  
“They say nothing good lasts forever. This was terribly true in my case. Ms. Ong got married 
and moved out of my school. And from Primary Two onwards I was taught by teachers whom 
I felt had somehow escaped from Hell.”  
GPT-4o identified M7 from the beginning until the end of this paragraph and labelled M8 for 
the last sentence, overlapping with part of M7. However, human coders classified “They say 
nothing good lasts forever. This was terribly true in my case.” as M7, as it philosophically 
encapsulates and elevates the main idea. They classified “Ms. Ong got married and moved out 
of my school. And from Primary Two onwards I was taught by teachers whom I felt had 
somehow escaped from Hell.” as M8, because it comments on the story and returns to the 
author’s experience from Primary Two onwards with a sense of pessimism. The use of critical 
language in this final section achieved a contrast effect.  
These differences likely stem from several underlying reasons. First, linguistic complexity and 
ambiguity play a significant role. In moves like “Foregrounding the main idea” (M7) and 
“Ending the story” (M8), the overlap in segmentation suggests that GPT-4o may struggle to 
distinguish nuanced transitions in the narrative flow. Human coders rely on deeper contextual 
understanding, such as recognizing when a philosophical statement concludes a central theme, 
while GPT-4o may depend too heavily on surface-level patterns like sentence structure or 
keywords, leading to misaligned coding. Another factor is the lack of cultural or emotional 
depth. As an AI, GPT-4o processes language through algorithms and datasets, excelling at 
identifying structural patterns but often missing subtle emotional or cultural cues that human 
coders use to define narrative endpoints. For instance, the transition between the emotional 
farewell to Ms. Ong and the protagonist’s return to a more challenging environment requires 
an understanding of the shift in tone, which GPT-4o might not fully grasp. Additionally, there 
is overlap in thematic content, especially in personal and emotional stories, where certain 
narrative moves serve multiple functions. In this case, the sentences in M7 that reflect Ms. 
Ong’s departure and the change in the protagonist’s circumstances could logically be seen as 
both the conclusion of M7 and the beginning of M8. Human coders, with their experience and 
interpretive judgment, are better suited to navigating such overlaps, whereas GPT-4o might 
struggle to determine where one function ends and another begins. Finally, the cyclical nature 
of certain moves presents challenges. The repetition of Moves 4 (Complicating the story) and 
6 (Dealing with the complication) shows how stories loop through similar thematic stages. This 
cyclical structure could confuse GPT-4o’s more linear approach to move segmentation, 
whereas human coders are better equipped to recognize and mark the recurrence of moves and 
their significance in the narrative. 
Even though there are slight differences between GPT-4o and human coders in the 
determination of the start and end points for the moves, this does not affect the range, 
frequency, and sequence of the moves. This suggested that GPT-4o could identify moves in 
narrative short stories and that it followed a structured process. It began with Phase 1: Text 
Extraction and Cleaning, where the narrative text was extracted and cleaned to focus solely on 
the story’s content. In Phase 2: Text Understanding and Analysis, GPT-4o thoroughly read the 
cleaned text to grasp the narrative’s characters, plot, and key events. Phase 3: Move 
Identification and Tagging involved classifying text chunks according to the eight moves and 
determining their start and endpoints. During Phase 4: Annotation and Description, GPT-4o 
annotated these moves, underlined parts that illustrated each move’s function, and provided 
brief descriptions. Phase 5: Recurring Move Analysis involves examining the narrative for
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
recurring moves and their effects on the story’s cyclical progression. The information was then 
organized into a table in Phase 6: Table Creation and Summary, detailing Move No., Functions, 
Start & End Points, and Descriptions. Finally, Phase 7: Review and Adjustment ensured that 
the table and annotations were accurate and aligned with Jiang et al.’s (2024) model, providing 
a comprehensive analysis of the narrative.

Based on the results in Table 4, a 100% inclusion rate of Move 1 to 6 makes these moves all 
obligatory in the 50 narrative short stories from Tests & Us (Volumes 2 & 3). A total of 98% 
and 90% inclusion rate for Moves 7 and 8 were shown respectively, making them conventional 
moves. There were no optional moves found in this study. The results indicated that for the 1st 
stage (Orientation) and 2nd stage (Incident), the moves are consistently present, highlighting 
their fundamental role in structuring the narrative. For the 3rd stage (Conclusion), the high 
inclusion rates of Moves 7 and 8 demonstrate their significant, though not essential, role in 
enhancing the narrative. This stage consolidates the narrative’s main idea and provides closure, 
which is crucial for reader satisfaction and the overall coherence of the story.  
Imagine a narrative short story as a meticulously crafted house. For the obligatory moves, 
Setting the scene (Move 1) is akin to laying the foundation of the house, providing the essential 
groundwork without which the entire structure would be unstable. This foundational move is 
supported by Martin & Rose (2008), who emphasize the necessity of establishing context to 
ground the reader. Laying out the event (Move 2) acts like the walls that define the space within 
the house, organizing the sequence of occurrences. According to Swales (1990), the logical 
progression of events is crucial for maintaining coherence in academic writing, which parallels 
narrative storytelling. Given that the current situation (Move 3) is comparable to erecting a 
roof, creating a temporary shelter before the storm of complications hits. This move prepares 
readers for the upcoming conflict, akin to how a roof protects the interior from external 
elements. Complicating the story (Move 4) is like introducing architectural elements that 
challenge the structure, such as intricate staircases or unconventional designs. These elements 
disrupt the normalcy and create intrigue. Bruner (1991) highlights the importance of conflict 
and disruption in narrative construction, which aligns with this move. Evaluating the status quo 
(Move 5) can be seen as the interior load-bearing walls that sustain the tension and weight of 
the structure. Martin & Rose (2008) note that evaluation increases narrative tension, essential 
for engaging the reader. Dealing with the complication (Move 6) is like the structural 
reinforcements that resolve any weaknesses, ensuring the house stands firm. This move
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
provides the necessary resolution, analogous to resolving structural issues in a building.  
For the conventional moves, Foregrounding the main idea (Move 7) is like the interior design 
that highlights the house’s theme, bringing cohesion and aesthetic appeal. This move 
reinterprets the story’s central theme, making it more impactful. Previous studies, such as 
Labov (1972), emphasize the importance of a coda or resolution that reiterates the narrative’s 
core message. However, in the data analysed by the researcher, sometimes authors intentionally 
do not explicitly state the theme, leaving space for readers to guess, ponder, and reflect. For 
example, in the third story, “Two Hours”, written by Vahid Nimechisalem, the author does not 
use Move 7 in the Conclusion stage to directly highlight the theme, which is the value of time. 
Instead, the author advances the plot by describing how the protagonist, Elissa, does not need 
to continue answering the unfinished questions in her first formal English exam. When she 
leaves the exam room and returns home, she learns from her parents the meaning of the “two 
hours” noted at the top of the exam paper. This approach of resolving the suspense without 
directly revealing the theme is intended to leave space for readers to think deeply about the 
theme, thereby achieving the effect of conveying boundless meaning through limited words. 
This subtlety allows the story’s deeper significance to emerge from the narrative, encouraging 
readers to engage in reflection and interpretation. 
Ending the story (Move 8) is akin to the final touches and furnishings that make the house feel 
complete and lived-in. This move provides closure, comparable to how finishing touches make 
a house feel like a home. Research by Thornbury & Slade (2006) indicates that effective 
narrative endings provide a sense of closure and satisfaction, enhancing the overall storytelling 
experience. As observed by the researcher, some authors also intentionally omit Move 8. For 
example, in Rong Lu’s short story “I’d Rather Be a Student”, the teacher recounts a difficult 
experience with a student named Dick. Despite the teacher’s efforts to establish clear rules and 
grading criteria, Dick shows disinterest, misses classes, and fails to give his oral presentations. 
As the semester progresses, Dick avoids penalties for absences and manages to sit for the final 
exam, despite his poor performance. The story reaches a turning point when Mr. Black, the 
department head and Dick’s relative, pressures the teacher to pass Dick despite his inadequate 
performance. Torn between professional integrity and career concerns, the teacher reluctantly 
adjusts Dick’s exam answers to ensure he passes. The story ends with the teacher feeling 
ashamed and disheartened, reflecting on the gap between her personal values and her role’s 
demands. The omission of Move 8, typically a clear statement or return to the present, serves 
several key purposes. Firstly, it amplifies the emotional impact by leaving the narrative open-
ended, preserving the teacher’s internal conflict and disillusionment. This lack of resolution 
underscores the moral ambiguity and unresolved tension, encouraging readers to engage deeply 
with the teacher’s ethical and personal dilemmas. The absence of this move highlights the 
teacher’s internal struggle rather than offering a neat conclusion or moral lesson. This narrative 
choice emphasizes her feelings of shame and frustration with the educational system, focusing 
on her emotional experience rather than resolving the external conflict. It aligns with the story’s 
theme of systemic unfairness. The omission also invites readers to reflect on the broader 
implications of the story. Without a clear closure, the narrative prompts readers to consider 
their perspectives on fairness, integrity, and the challenges within the educational system, 
highlighting the real-life consequences of systemic issues. Finally, not including Move 8 
maintains the story’s ambiguity and complexity. The open-ended nature of the ending leaves a 
lasting impression of the protagonist’s unresolved conflict, enhancing the emotional resonance 
of the narrative and reflecting the ongoing and unresolved nature of real-life educational issues.

Table 5 shows the total instances or the total number of moves used in the 50 narrative short 
stories from Tests & Us (Volumes 2 & 3). The total number of moves across these stories is 
478, and each move contributes differently in terms of frequency. 
From the data, Move 4, “Complicating the story”, is the most frequent, occurring 80 times and 
accounting for 16.7% of all moves. This high frequency suggests that complications, crises, or 
climactic moments are central to narrative storytelling, aligning with the idea that tension or 
conflict is essential to keep readers engaged (Labov & Waletzky, 1967).  The close follow-up 
by Move 5, “Evaluating the status quo” (79 occurrences, 16.5%), further emphasizes that 
narratives often involve reflecting on or assessing the complication, which adds depth to the 
story and conveys character emotions or moral lessons (Bamberg, 2012). As a natural 
progression, Move 6, “Dealing with the complication,” follows this assessment and focuses on 
how characters actively respond to the crises they face. This move, occurring 75 times (15.7%), 
illustrates the resolution or attempt to manage the complications, showing that resolving or 
addressing crises is a critical step in narrative development. 
For example, in the short story I’m a Cat by Diyah Indiyati, the author portrays the deep bond 
between a cat and its master, who struggles to achieve a higher IELTS score, ultimately finding 
comfort in the cat’s unwavering emotional support. Two sets of Move 4, Move 5 and Move 6 
are used, meaning these three moves appear cyclically.  
In the first set, Moves 4, 5, and 6 play critical roles in developing the master’s journey from 
frustration to renewed hope. 
Move 4: Complicating the story 
In this move, the master’s frustration with his tutor comes to the forefront: “On a dreadfully 
hot afternoon, he grabbed me and put me on his lap, saying that his tutor was always 
demeaning his speaking effort.” This complication reveals the emotional burden he carries due 
to an unsupportive learning environment, where the tutor’s harsh criticism discourages him 
rather than helping him improve. The master’s decision to find a new tutor reflects his 
determination to address this challenge, setting the stage for further development in the story. 
Move 5: Evaluating the status quo 
The evaluation of the situation occurs after the master finds a new, supportive tutor who offers 
constructive feedback: “Don’t worry, Andi, just learn one step at a time. Try to use more words 
in one sentence.” This move highlights the turning point in the master’s journey, where the 
new tutor provides clear guidance on how to improve his speaking skills. The contrast with the
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
previous tutor’s demeaning approach shows the positive impact of an encouraging teacher, as 
the master begins to build confidence and see progress in his preparation for the IELTS exam. 
Move 6: Dealing with the complication 
In this move, the master actively addresses his challenge by embracing the new tutor’s guidance 
and regaining his confidence: “This time seemed different; his confidence grew bigger with 
this new tutor. ‘I’ll have my speaking test today, Fluffy, and I’m very confident more than ever. 
I’m all set.’” The master’s renewed optimism demonstrates his resilience and ability to 
overcome setbacks. He prepares for the speaking test with a sense of readiness, showing that 
he has successfully dealt with the previous complication by finding a better learning 
environment. 
In the second set, we see another cycle of challenge, reflection, and response, this time focusing 
on the emotional impact of the master’s test results and the cat’s role in comforting him. 
Move 4: Complicating the story 
The complication arises when the master eagerly awaits the results of his IELTS test: “The 
result came two weeks after the test, as I saw a postman put it inside the letterbox outside the 
house. My master sprinted eagerly to pick up that document, ripped its seal, and opened the 
one-page document.” This marks a significant moment of hope and anticipation, but the 
complication is introduced when the master’s expectations are dashed by the disappointing test 
results. The high hopes he had for success are shattered, setting the stage for the emotional 
challenge he must now face. 
Move 5: Evaluating the status quo 
The evaluation occurs as the master reacts to his disappointing score of 5.5: “Suddenly, his 
body slipped onto the couch and his eyes looked away. The paper sagged down to the floor.” 
This evaluation highlights the emotional weight of the setback, as the master’s body language 
reflects his deep sense of failure and frustration. Despite all his hard work and newfound 
confidence, the score signifies that his efforts have fallen short, leading to emotional deflation 
and introspection. 
Move 6: Dealing with the complication 
Dealing with the complication is shown when the cat responds to the master’s distress: “I walk, 
approaching him, to the couch and jump onto his lap. I give him the best language I have 
learned so far: a gentle purr and a soft head butting.” The cat’s actions provide emotional 
comfort, offering a non-verbal way of addressing the master’s sadness. Though the problem 
(the test score) remains unsolved, the cat helps the master cope with his emotions, showing the 
strength of their bond. This move reflects the narrative’s focus on emotional support rather than 
a direct resolution of the external issue, emphasizing that sometimes comfort and 
companionship are the best ways to handle disappointment. 
In this set of moves, the master’s emotional arc is explored deeply, showing how complications 
and emotional challenges can be met with compassion and non-verbal communication, 
reinforcing the theme of resilience in the face of setbacks. 
In addition to Moves 4, 5, and 6, Moves 1, 2, and 3 each appear 50 times (10.5%), indicating 
the importance of establishing the setting and context early in the stories, a common technique 
to immerse readers in the narrative world. Finally, Move 7, “Foregrounding the main idea” (49 
occurrences, 10.3%), and Move 8, “Ending the story” (45 occurrences, 9.4%), are the least 
frequent, suggesting that while conclusions and reflections are important, they take up less 
narrative space than the development and resolution of the plot. This might reflect a tendency
ASEAN Journal of Applied Linguistics | Vol 3, Issue 1 | eISSN 3009-0539 
in storytelling to prioritize the progression of action and conflict over the denouement (Bruner, 
1990). 
 
Conclusion  
This study aimed to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o in conducting rhetorical move analysis 
on narrative short stories based on the theme of language assessment. By adopting Jiang et al.’s 
(2024) eight-move model, the results indicate that GPT-4o’s move identification aligned 
closely with human coders, despite small differences in the segmentation of certain moves. The 
discrepancies in move segmentation are likely due to GPT-4o’s reliance on surface-level 
patterns, whereas human coders employ deeper contextual understanding, such as emotional 
or cultural cues, to determine move boundaries. Regarding essentiality, the obligatory moves 
(Move 1-Move 6) were consistently identified in all stories, while the conventional moves 
(Move 7 and Move 8) were identified with slightly lower rates. Concerning occurrence, the 
overall moves totalled 478. Move 4 (Complicating the story) was the most frequent, occurring 
80 times (16.7%), followed by Move 5 (Evaluating the status quo) with 79 occurrences 
(16.5%), and Move 6 (Dealing with the complication) appearing 75 times (15.7%). Move 1 
(Setting the scene), Move 2 (Laying out the event), and Move 3 (Giving the current situation) 
each occurred 50 times (10.5%). Move 7 (Foregrounding the main idea) appeared 49 times 
(10.3%), and Move 8 (Ending the story) was the least frequent, with 45 occurrences (9.4%). 
This study demonstrated that GPT-4o is capable of effectively identifying rhetorical moves in 
narrative short stories. It highlighted the model’s ability to analyse narrative structure using an 
established rhetorical move framework and provided insights into how AI can support textual 
analysis in creative writing. The findings suggest that AI tools like GPT-4o could be integrated 
into educational settings to assist with narrative analysis, helping students and educators to 
better understand story structure and rhetorical strategies. 
A limitation of this study is the size of the corpus, as it included only 50 narrative short stories. 
A larger and more diverse corpus may provide a broader range of rhetorical structures, offering 
more insights into the model’s accuracy and flexibility across different narrative types. 
Additionally, GPT-4o struggled with subtle transitions between moves, especially when 
cultural or emotional depth influenced the narrative flow. Further research is recommended to 
examine GPT-4o’s performance across different narrative genres and to refine its capabilities 
for detecting rhetorical intricacies.
