Abstract 
AI advancements have made ChatGPT a remarkable and versatile tool in education and linguistics, showcasing its 
potential to mimic human conversation and comprehend language. Scholars are intrigued by ChatGPT’s text data 
handling, yet its application in rhetorical move analysis remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the objective of 
this study is to investigate the ability of GPT-4 in the identification of rhetorical moves employed in the abstracts 
of tourism research articles indexed in Scopus. The essentiality of moves was also reported. Additionally, this 
research seeks to compare the accuracy of GPT-4’s analysis with that of humans. Adopting Hyland’s (2000) five-
move model, the results indicated that GPT-4 analyzes moves more quickly but less accurately than human experts, 
and the four principal types of errors committed by GPT-4 include redundancy/over-count, unmatched 
categorization, incorrect sequence, and vague identification. The findings also revealed that Move 2 (Purpose) and 
Move 4 (Findings) are obligatory with a 100% essentiality rate through both GPT-4 and human analysis. 
Differences arise in certain steps of Move 1 (Introduction), Move 3 (Methods), and Move 5 (Conclusion), where 
GPT-4 often sees higher essentiality rates. This study shed light on the testament to AI’s current capabilities in 
move analysis in academic discourse.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, there has been wide interest in genre analysis of abstract writing. An abstract serves as a 
representative of the research by providing a concise yet precise synopsis of the article. The abstract functions as 
a guide to the article, stimulating readers to proceed with the reading. In the case of journals, the acceptance or 
rejection of a paper is typically determined by the quality of the abstract. For research articles to be published in 
prestigious journals indexed by Scopus, a concise and informative abstract is essential (Geng & Wei, 2023). 
Previous studies have investigated the rhetorical structure of research article abstracts across multiple soft science 
disciplines, including education (Sidek, 2017), literature (Tankó, 2017), applied linguistics (Fauzan et al., 2020), 
psychology (Gusmana, 2023), history (Saidi & Karami, 2024), geography (Alyousef, 2023), economics (Fitria, 
2022), among others. However, within the tourism discipline, there have been few studies on the rhetorical move 
structures of research article abstracts, particularly those indexed by Scopus (Kurniawan & Sabila, 2021). 
Furthermore, in most move analysis studies, researchers commonly conducted move identification manually, a 
process that consumes a significant amount of time. With the advent and the evolution of artificial intelligence, 
ChatGPT which employs natural language processing has shown potential as an effective aid in the academic 
community. At present, several studies are looking into the suitability and effectiveness of ChatGPT in educational 
settings. An illustration of this can be seen in the research conducted by Adeshola and Adepoju (2023), which 
utilized sentiment analysis to conclude that the majority of individuals express positive opinions regarding 
ChatGPT. Another example is that Livberber (2023) investigated the utility of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) as 
a writing tool and found that it has the potential to logically and appropriately specify the steps to follow in the 
design of an academic article. Nevertheless, scant attention has been paid to ChatGPT’s capability to conduct 
textual analysis, which is a research method used by scholars to interpret, analyze, and understand the content, 
structure, and various elements of the text. So far only one study has shown that GPT-4 could conduct conceptual 
metaphors and thematic analysis of short stories (Geng & Nimehchisalem, 2023).

Thus, is there a possibility of employing AI to conduct other various types of textual analysis including discourse, 
sentiment, and stylistic analysis, as well as for linguistic analysis encompassing lexical, semantic, pragmatic, genre, 
frame, and intertextuality analysis? Given that rhetorical move analysis can be considered a part of genre analysis, 
which focuses on understanding how texts achieve specific communicative objectives by examining their 
structural and strategic components, it is worthwhile to leverage the AI-powered tool ChatGPT for experiments to 
assess its feasibility to accurately identify these rhetorical moves. Based on this, the current study aims to fill the 
gap by investigating the ability of GPT-4 to identify rhetorical moves in abstracts of tourism research articles from 
a Scopus-indexed journal. The findings of this research not only underscore the remarkable prospects of exploiting 
artificial intelligence, especially ChatGPT, for improving academic writing as well as research methods but also 
open new possibilities for genre analysis.  
2. Literature Review 
In academic writing, the abstract is recognized by authors as a concise and accurate summary of the content of a 
research article, marking its unique place as a specific genre within scholarly prose. According to Swales & Feak 
(2004), it is a crucial navigational tool, allowing readers to quickly ascertain the relevance and applicability of the 
research to their work. In the digital age, the abstract’s role has expanded beyond the article itself to include its 
visibility in electronic databases and search engines. Biber et al. (2007) noted that well-crafted abstracts improve 
the article’s discoverability, significantly affecting its readership and citation rates. Keywords and phrases within 
the abstract enhance the article’s search engine optimization (SEO), making it more accessible to a global audience. 
Given the pivotal role of abstracts in deciding the fate of manuscripts, several frameworks have been developed to 
analyze their structural composition (Bhatia, 1993; Santos, 1996; Swales, 1990), among which Hyland’s (2000) 
five-move model is notably comprehensive, covering introduction, purpose, method, results, and conclusion 
sections (Ghasempour & Farnia, 2017). 
These models suggest universal guidelines for organizing abstracts across various fields. However, the specific 
rhetorical structures of tourism abstracts in Scopus-indexed journals have not been extensively explored. Founded 
in November 2004, Scopus is the largest abstract and citation database, exceeding the Web of Science Core 
Collection in journal coverage. It provides advanced tools for research tracking, analysis, and visualization, 
establishing it as a highly reputable bibliometric database (Joshi, 2016). As mentioned by Geng (2024), Scopus-
indexed journals have gained much recognition on various occasions. For example, many universities in Malaysia 
as well as in the world hope their academicians publish in Scopus-indexed, ISI (now Web of Science), and other 
high-impact factor journals. As a result, a detailed analysis of how the rhetorical moves were used in Scopus-
indexed tourism research articles is worth further exploring.  
Rhetorical moves, as identified by Ding (2007), are schematic units that denote textual regularities, socially 
recognized for their formal structure, which fulfills a coherent communicative function in written discourse 
(Swales, 2004). A move is seen as a chunk of text, encompassing at least one complete sentence with a specific 
communicative function, indicating that any sentence or group of sentences meeting the criteria of a move or step 
in the coding system was considered an instance of that move or step, irrespective of length (Geng et al., 2023; 
Zhang & Wannaruk, 2016). 
In the coding phase, moves or steps are counted as single instances if uninterrupted, but as separate instances if 
interrupted by different moves or steps (Geng et al., 2023). Various assisted annotation software tools for coding 
rhetorical moves have been examined, such as Mover, Research Writing Tutor, Academic Writing Analytics 
(AWA), and AcaWriter tools (Knight et al., 2020). However, to the researchers’ knowledge, there has been no 
study to date that utilizes ChatGPT (GPT-4) for the coding of rhetorical moves within academic texts. As a type 
of Large Language Model (LLM) and a prominent framework for generative artificial intelligence (AI), The 
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), commonly referred to as ChatGPT, has attracted significant public 
interest after it reached version 3.5 (Reiss, 2023). GPT-4, unveiled by OpenAI on March 14, 2023, is a recent 
version of OpenAI’s GPT series. It is an enhanced version of GPT-3.5 with the superior capacity to identify 
nuances and deliver more accurate and logical responses (Bubeck et al., 2023). 
As tested by researchers, Savelka et al. (2023) claimed that GPT-4 can analyze textual data in the context of a task 
involving the interpretation of legal concepts at a level comparable to that of law student annotators who have 
received adequate training. Another study reported that GPT-4 can assist in qualitative data analysis, and careful 
prompt structuring can align AI responses closely with human interpretations, particularly in deductive analysis 
(Siiman, 2023). The previous findings suggested that there is a need to explore more about GPT-4’s ability to 
analyze different types of textual data. Hence, the current study aims to fill this gap in how GPT-4 can assist 
humans in genre analysis, particularly in move analysis.
