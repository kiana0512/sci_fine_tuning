Natural language processing (NLP) is a computer-based approach to linguistic analysis that ap­
plies algorithmic techniques to textual data, enabling the extraction of complex patterns and the 
examination of language structures. In second language (L2) writing research, NLP techniques 
have facilitated increasingly sophisticated analyses of semantic features, extending beyond 
traditional structural measures to capture deeper mechanisms of meaning construction. While 
previous studies have explored various dimensions of L2 writing through NLP-based approaches, 
less attention has been given to how genre influences semantic cohesion, particularly in verb 
usage. This study investigates genre effects on verb semantic cohesion in L2 writing, using an 
NLP-based semantic network analysis of narrative and argumentative essays written by higher- 
and lower-proficiency L2 learners. The semantic network analysis identifies how verbs function as 
semantic anchors within constructions, illuminating cohesion patterns that reflect writers’ con­
ceptual organization. Results indicated that higher-proficiency writers demonstrated stronger 
semantic cohesion and more sophisticated verb usage in argumentative essays, characterized by 
denser and more interconnected verb networks. In contrast, their narrative essays showed less 
complex networks with concrete action verbs. Lower-proficiency writers exhibited less pro­
nounced differentiation between genres, relying on a restricted range of verbs across both types of 
writing. These findings suggest that advanced L2 writing proficiency is marked by the ability to 
adapt verb usage to genre-specific demands, aligning with usage-based approaches to language 
learning. These findings are discussed in light of their potential implications for L2 writing in­
struction and assessment, emphasizing the importance of considering semantic cohesion and 
genre-appropriate verb usage.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, the emergence of advanced computational techniques has enabled rapid and precise analysis of extensive learner 
corpus data, particularly in the assessment of linguistic structures as indicators of second language (L2) writing quality. This process 
has been pronounced in research examining the syntactic complexity of L2 writing. Studies in this area have developed and validated a 
wide range of indices that reliably capture the diversity and sophistication of structural units, including clauses, phrases, and argument 
structure constructions (e.g., Biber et al., 2016; Bult´e & Housen, 2012; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Lu, 2011, 2017; Norris & Ortega, 2009; 
Wolf-Quintero et al., 1998). In addition, several studies have identified the interactive roles of learner-internal and learner-external

factors, such as text genre, task complexity, modality, the writer’s familiarity with the topic, motivation, and collaborative planning (e. 
g., Abdi Tabari & Wang, 2022; Casal & Kessler, 2020; Huang & Li, 2023; Kang & Lee, 2019; Li & Yu, 2024; Mostafa & Crossley, 2020; 
Kim & Ro, 2024; Pu et al., 2022; Yoon, 2017; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022).
However, previous research has predominantly focused on structural features in learner essays, leaving the semantic dimensions of 
L2 writing relatively underexplored. This imbalance in research focus potentially limits our understanding of how learners develop 
their ability to convey meaning effectively in L2 writing, calling for the need to devote equal attention to both form and meaning 
(Crossley & McNamara, 2012). Exploring semantic features not only helps clarify how L2 learners’ conceptual understanding of 
phrasal and clausal units influences their written production but also provides additional predictive power in assessing L2 writing 
quality and development (O’Donnell et al., 2013). To address these gaps, the current study investigates how L2 learners employ 
semantically cohesive verbs within specific argument structure constructions in written production, while also testing the potential 
effects of genre and L2 writing proficiency.
This study expands the scope of previous research in two major ways. First, our investigation into verb semantics in writing is firmly 
grounded in usage-based approaches to language learning (Bybee, 2008; Goldberg, 1995, 2006, 2019), which posit that language 
acquisition involves recognizing and internalizing conventionalized patterns in the combination of verbs and argument structure 
constructions (i.e., clause-level units of form-meaning pairings; Goldberg, 1995, 2006). According to this perspective, language 
learners gradually acquire knowledge of the distributional properties of verb–construction pairings, facilitating the induction of 
statistical regularities in their co-occurrence (Ellis et al., 2016; Goldberg, 1995, 2006, 2019; Robinson & Ellis, 2008; Tomasello, 2003).
One critical component of this statistical learning is the semantic coherence of verbs within constructions. Verb semantic cohesion 
refers to the degree to which verbs used within specific constructions are semantically related to one another (Ellis & Larsen-Freeman, 
2009; Ellis et al., 2016). According to Ellis et al. (2016), verb semantic cohesion serves as a key indicator of constructional knowledge 
development, along with the frequency and contingency of verb–construction pairings, reflecting learners’ ability to employ 
semantically consistent verbs that align with the core meanings of the constructions. Building on this theoretical framework, our study 
extends these insights to the context of L2 writing by employing verb semantic network analysis (e.g. Gries & Ellis, 2015; Wulff et al., 
2007).
Additionally, this study seeks to examine the potential influence of text genre and writing proficiency on the semantic cohesion of 
verbs in L2 writing. A substantial body of research has explored genre effects in L2 writing, with a primary focus on the relationship 
between genre-specific cognitive complexity and linguistic complexity (e.g., Goh & Burns, 2012; Kim & Ro, 2024; Qin & Uccelli, 2016; 
Renandya & Nguyen, 2023; Yoon, 2017, 2021; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). Findings from these studies indicate that L2 
learners tend to employ more complex linguistic structures in non-narrative genres, such as argumentative writing, than in narrative 
genres. Based on Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis (2001, 2003), this tendency is attributed to the greater cognitive demands of 
non-narrative genres, which necessitate higher levels of linguistic complexity.
However, it remains unclear whether this genre effect applies to the semantic aspects of L2 writing, particularly regarding verb 
semantic cohesion, and how it interacts with L2 writing proficiency. Among many linguistic elements, verbs play a central role in 
structuring discourse, encoding event relations, argument structure, and information flow (Gentner, 1982; Levin, 1993). Given their 
fundamental role in establishing coherence within a text (Gries & Ellis, 2015), it is plausible that genre effects influence the semantic 
cohesion of verbs as well. Moreover, since the ability to construct cohesive texts often requires greater attentional resources and 
proficiency (Kormos, 2011), the genre effect on verb semantic cohesion is likely to be more pronounced among higher-proficiency 
writers, who tend to possess a broader repertoire of linguistic resources and greater genre awareness.
To test these hypotheses, we employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze verb semantics within individual 
constructions in narrative and argumentative essays produced by 919 college-level L2 learners with beginner and upper-intermediate 
proficiency levels. This study investigates whether the previously observed genre effect extends to the semantic cohesion of verbs 
within individual constructions. Furthermore, it explores whether these genre effects manifest differently across L2 writers with 
different proficiency levels. Based on usage-based perspectives, we specifically aim to determine whether advanced L2 writers exhibit 
greater flexibility in their verb choices and semantic relationships across different genres compared to less proficient writers.
3. The current study
Building on previous research on genre effects in L2 writing and the theoretical frameworks of usage-based approaches and the 
Cognition Hypothesis, this study investigates how genre and proficiency influence verb semantic cohesion in L2 writing. Given the 
fundamental role of verbs in structuring discourse (Gentner, 1982; Levin, 1993) and establishing coherence within a text (Gries & Ellis, 
2015), we hypothesize that the previously observed genre effects on syntactic complexity will extend to verb semantic cohesion. 
Specifically, we expect argumentative essays to exhibit higher levels of semantic cohesion than narrative essays, due to the increased 
cognitive demands typically associated with argumentative writing (Robinson, 2001, 2003). Furthermore, we predict that these genre 
effects will be more pronounced among higher-proficiency writers. This expectation is grounded in usage-based approaches to lan­
guage learning, which propose that as learners gain more experience with the target language, they develop a more sophisticated 
understanding of how verbs and constructions function within various communicative contexts (Ellis et al., 2016; Tomasello, 2003).
To test these hypotheses, the study poses the following research questions: 
1. To what extent does the semantic cohesion of verbs within individual constructions differ between narrative and argumentative 
essays?
2. How does L2 proficiency influence the semantic cohesion of verbs within constructions across genres?

4. Method
4.1. Corpus data
4.1.1. Corpus description
We retrieved writing samples from the Yonsei English Learner Corpus (YELC; Rhee & Jung, 2012), which comprised narrative and 
argumentative essays written by Korean-speaking students at Yonsei University. Each participant supplied one narrative and one 
argumentative essay, resulting in a total dataset of 1838 writing samples. Table 1 provides a summary of the samples used in the 
current study, categorized by genre and proficiency group.
4.1.2. Data collection procedure
According to the corpus compilers, the data collection process was designed to closely mirror the test administration format of the 
TOEFL iBT. During data collection, each participant completed computer-based writing tasks within a 1-h session, which included both 
narrative and argumentative writing tasks. The narrative prompt required students to share personal experiences on familiar topics, 
such as their favorite high school extracurricular activity or recent travel experiences. On the other hand, the argumentative task 
required them to engage in academic discourse on specific issues, such as the debate over banning smoking in public places. A complete 
list of essay topics for each genre is available in Appendix A in the supplementary materials.
4.1.3. Essay evaluation
Following the collection of the essays, trained raters, comprising both native English speakers and highly proficient English 
learners, evaluated each essay using the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR, Council of Europe, 2011) rubric. Each 
essay was subsequently stratified into one of the nine proficiency levels: A1, A1+, A2, B1, B1+, B2, B2+, C1, C2. To ensure clear 
distinctions between proficiency levels, we selected 460 participants from the A1, A1+, and A2 levels and categorized them as the 
lower-proficiency group, and 459 participants from the B2 and B2+ levels to form the higher-proficiency group.1 According to the 
CEFR level descriptors, the lower-proficiency group consists of basic or beginner writers who can produce simple sentences on personal 
topics using basic connectors, express likes and dislikes, and write brief notes about immediate needs. In contrast, the 
higher-proficiency group consists of independent or upper-intermediate learners who are capable of writing clear, detailed texts on 
various subjects within their area of expertise, synthesizing information from multiple sources, and effectively expressing opinions 
while engaging with the views of others.
4.1.4. Data preparation
Since our primary focus was on learners’ use of verb types within particular constructions, we corrected spelling errors in the 
essays, which helped improve verb lemmatization and ensure the accuracy of our automatic analysis (e.g., Zhang & Lu, 2022).
4.2. Construction identification and verb semantic network analysis
Before conducting the verb semantic network analysis, we first identified key constructions within the written samples, employing 
a construction classification algorithm outlined by Hwang et al. (2020). This initial step involved the application of several 
Python-based NLP tools to analyze and classify construction types in the text samples. The analysis began with sentence segmentation, 
conducted using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK; Bird et al., 2009), an open-source Python library widely used for NLP tasks, 
available at https://www.nltk.org/. Using NLTK, we decomposed each sample text into individual sentences. Following segmentation, 
we extracted syntactic features from each sentence using spaCy (Honnibal & Montani, 2019). This extraction process involved a series 
of tasks: tokenization, which divided sentences into clauses2; lemmatization, which reduced words within each clause to their base or 
lemma forms; part-of-speech tagging, where each token was labeled with its corresponding syntactic category; and dependency 
parsing, which identified the syntactic relationships among tokens, capturing the underlying argument structures of each clause.
Based on the syntactic dependency information obtained from these processes, each clause was classified into one of eleven primary 
construction types. To ensure a robust and meaningful analysis, we further narrowed our focus to six specific constructions that 
exhibited high frequency and contained an adequate number of verb instances within the samples, making them suitable for 
comprehensive network analysis. The classification algorithms for these six constructions are illustrated in (2).

a. Intransitive: [Subject] + [Verb] + (Optional Adverbial Phrase)

b. Intransitive motion: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Path/Location Prepositional Phrase]

1 While our dataset included essays from C1 and C2 levels, we chose to exclude them from our higher-proficiency group due to the limited number 
of samples (37 essays at C1 and 2 essays at C2). Including these levels could have introduced unnecessary heterogeneity into our analysis, potentially 
skewing the results. By focusing on the B2 and B2+ levels in the higher-proficiency group, we ensured a balanced comparison between proficiency 
groups while maintaining a substantial sample size for statistical analysis.
2 In this study, we define clauses following the approach used in Kyle (2016), which includes both finite and non-finite clauses. This definition was 
chosen to capture the characteristics of argument structure constructions, which can manifest in both finite and non-finite forms.

The validity of this classification algorithm was confirmed through a comparison with human-annotated classifications, as reported 
in Hwang et al. (2020).3 This comparison demonstrated high efficacy, achieving a recall of 0.82, precision of 0.86, and an F1 value of 
0.82. Detailed information about the construction classification algorithms and their applications in research can be found at https:// 
haerimhwang.github.io/tools/English-constructional-diversity-analyzer.
For each of the identified constructions, we conducted a semantic network analysis of the verbs used within them, following a 
structured approach based on Gries and Ellis (2015). We began with verb tokenization using the NLTK package, ensuring a precise 
identification of verbs across the dataset. For an accurate comparison of semantic properties of verbs, we lemmatized verb forms using 
the WordNetLemmatizer, which draws on the WordNet lexical database (Pedersen et al., 2004). Subsequently, to explore and quantify 
the semantic relationships between the lemmatized verbs, we utilized the WordNet Path Similarity measure, which assesses the se­
mantic similarity between verb synsets on a scale from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical synset). Using this similarity data, we con­
structed undirected graphs for each construction, using the networkx package (Hagberg et al., 2008). In these graphs, nodes 
represented individual verbs, while edges reflected strong semantic similarities, as determined by the Path Similarity measure. To 
further elucidate the internal structure of these networks, we applied the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008), identifying 
communities of semantically related verbs and color-coding them for clarity. These visualizations provided a detailed illustration of the 
overall network structure, highlighting prominent semantic clusters and thus allowing for assessing the semantic cohesion among 
verbs within each construction (Gries & Ellis, 2015).
To quantitatively assess verb semantic cohesion within the constructions, we calculated betweenness centrality for each con­
struction across our sample data. We specifically chose this metric for its distinctive utility among various measures of verb semantic 
cohesion, including network density, average clustering, closeness centrality, Katz centrality, and degree centrality (Baronchelli et al., 
2013; de Nooy et al., 2018). Betweenness centrality, grounded in network theory, evaluates the extent to which a particular node (i.e., 
verb) functions as a crucial bridge within the network, facilitating connections along the shortest paths between other nodes (Freeman, 
1977; Newman, 2010). This measure is particularly useful for understanding how learners expand constructional knowledge, as verbs 
with high betweenness centrality facilitate integrating new verbs into existing patterns. Moreover, focusing on this metric allows for 
meaningful comparisons with previous studies that have employed it (e.g., Ellis et al., 2013; Ellis & Ferreira-Junior, 2009; Gries & Ellis, 
2015).
A verb network exhibiting high betweenness centrality values indicates that certain verbs play a pivotal role as semantic anchors, 
linking disparate parts of the network. This connectivity enhances the overall coherence and cohesion of the semantic structure within 
the text (Gries & Ellis, 2015). The betweenness centrality of a node v is calculated using the following formula: 
CB(v) =
∑
{s∕=v∕=t}
σst(v)
σst 
• s and t are different nodes in the graph, distinct from v
• σst represents the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t
• σst(v) represents the number of those shortest paths that pass through node v
4.3. Statistical analysis
To investigate the potential effects of genre and proficiency on verb semantic cohesion, we employed a linear mixed-effects 
regression model (Bates et al., 2015) to estimate betweenness centrality values conditioned by the interaction of two fixed effects: 
genre (argumentative, narrative) and proficiency group (higher, lower). Each fixed factor was deviation-coded, with −0.5 assigned to 
argumentative essays and the higher group, and 0.5 assigned to narrative essays and the lower group. The model also included 
participants and constructions as random effects to account for individual variability and construction-specific influences. We initially 
constructed the maximal random effects structure, including by-participant and by-construction random slopes and intercepts for 
genre and proficiency group. However, due to issues with non-convergence, we simplified the model by removing the by-construction 
random slope. P-values were derived using the Satterthwaite approximation via the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2016). In case 
3 Since Hwang et al. (2020) validated their classification accuracy using the American National Corpus, which contains native English writing, 
their results may not directly apply to our learner data. To address this concern, we extracted a random sample of 100 sentences from our dataset 
and compared the automatic analysis results with human annotations. This analysis yielded high accuracy rates, with a recall of 0.96, a precision of 
0.97, and an F1 value of 0.96. These results indicate that the automatic analysis tool performs well on our L2 learner corpus as well.

of a significant interaction between genre and proficiency, we further conducted pairwise comparisons using the emmeans package 
(Lenth, 2018). Tukey adjustments were applied to account for multiple comparisons. All statistical modeling was performed using R 
version 4.3.3 (R Core Team, 2024).
5. Results
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics for the betweenness centrality values across the different genre and proficiency groups, 
followed by a jitter plot in Fig. 1.
The descriptive statistics revealed an opposite trend between the two proficiency groups. Specifically, for the higher-proficiency 
group, betweenness centrality values were notably higher in the argumentative compared to the narrative genre, whereas the 
lower-proficiency group exhibited higher values in the narrative genre.
To scrutinize these patterns in detail, we turned to the results of the mixed-effects model, which are summarized in Table 3.
The results showed significant effects of both genre and proficiency on betweenness centrality values. The genre effect was driven 
by generally higher betweenness centrality values in argumentative compared to narrative genres. The proficiency effect was due to 
higher values among the higher-proficiency group compared to the lower-proficiency group. Crucially, there was a significant 
interaction between genre and proficiency. Pairwise comparisons showed distinct patterns across the proficiency groups. The higher- 
proficiency group exhibited significantly higher betweenness centrality values in argumentative than narrative genres (b = 0.00003, 
SE = 0.000005, p < .001), indicating increased verb semantic cohesion in their argumentative essays. In contrast, for the lower- 
proficiency group, there was no significant difference between argumentative and narrative genres (b = −0.00001, SE = 0.00005, 
p = .101), suggesting that this group maintained similar degrees of verb semantic cohesion across both genres.
Consistent with these statistical findings, the semantic networks for each construction show distinct patterns between argumen­
tative and narrative essays across proficiency levels. A comprehensive overview of the semantic networks for all constructions is 
provided in Appendix B. To illustrate these patterns in detail, we present specific examples from the passive construction, which 
generally features a high level of linguistic sophistication and thus serves as an effective indicator of writing proficiency.
Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the verb semantic networks for passive sentences in argumentative essays produced by the higher- 
proficiency group, presenting both the complete and reduced versions. The intricate interconnections of verbs within the argumen­
tative network (Fig. 2) suggest that higher-proficiency writers utilized a complex set of semantically related verbs when constructing 
arguments in the passive voice. This network, characterized by high semantic density and cohesion, reflects the specific demands of 
argumentative writing, which requires the articulation, support, and refutation of various stances. In the reduced version of this 
network (Fig. 3), which includes only three nodes from each community, verbs such as “allow,” “permit,” “protect,” “restrict,” and 
“support” further highlight the analytical and often confrontational nature of argumentation.
In contrast, the semantic network for narrative essays produced by this group features a more streamlined array of verbs, char­
acterized by lower semantic density and reduced cohesion, as shown in Fig. 4. Unlike the argumentative network, where clear clusters 
of related verbs emerge, the narrative network exhibits a simpler structure, with semantic relationships centered around more basic 
and concrete actions. This linear organization reflects the sequential and event-driven nature of storytelling, where the narrative 
unfolds through the progression of events and the depiction of specific actions and experiences. For example, this network is domi­
nated by semantically light verbs such as “get,” “take,” “call,” and “move,” emphasizing the focus on personal experiences and actions 
that are central to narrative discourse. As a result, this network demonstrates less density, indicating the genre-specific differences in 
verb usage and semantic cohesion among the higher-proficiency group.
The higher-proficiency group’s ability to differentiate their verb usage in the passive construction depending on genre is clearly 
illustrated in the sample writing provided in Table 4. In this writer’s argumentative essay, the passive constructions include verbs such 
as “eclipsed,” “notified,” “protected,” and “used,” which are examples of more sophisticated and abstract verbs typically associated 
with argumentative discourse. The use of these verbs indicates the writer’s effort to present and critically analyze different viewpoints, 
a hallmark of the complex and analytic nature of argumentative writing. In the narrative sample, in contrast, the same writer produced 
passive sentences involving verbs such as “permitted,” “called,” and “told” to describe personal experiences and situations focusing on 
the writer. This choice reflects a common rhetorical strategy in narrative writing, where the focus shifts to personal storytelling. 
Beyond verb selection, this writer also exhibited an understanding of the different functions of passive sentences across genres. In the 
argumentative essay, passives were strategically used to depersonalize statements, potentially enhancing the persuasiveness of the 
argument. Conversely, in the narrative sample, passives were utilized to highlight experiences and emotions, which could increase the 
reader’s empathy and engagement with the personal story being conveyed. These distinctions suggest the writer’s ability to adapt the 
use of passive voice according to the genre, adjusting their linguistic choices to align with the specific communicative goals of

argumentation and narration.
Turning to the lower-proficiency group, the semantic networks for passive verbs are shown in Fig. 5 for argumentative essays and 
Fig. 6 for narrative essays. Compared to the higher-proficiency group, the difference in both the size and complexity of the networks 
between argumentative and narrative essays is less pronounced. While the argumentative network is still larger than the narrative 
network, both networks contain a more limited range of verbs compared to those of the higher-proficiency group. In particular, the 
argumentative network does not exhibit the same level of verb density and semantic clustering observed in the higher-proficiency 
group. This reduced distinction between verbs used in argumentative and narrative contexts reflects the lower-proficiency group’s 
tendency to rely on a more limited and generalized set of verbs across both genres. For instance, basic verbs such as “give,” “use,” “go,” 
and “take” appear frequently in both networks, indicating a more uniform approach to verb usage in passive constructions, regardless 
of the writing genre. This observation suggests that the lower-proficiency group may not have fully developed the ability to differ­
entiate and adapt their verb usage according to the specific rhetorical demands of argumentative versus narrative writing.
To illustrate the less pronounced distinction between the two genres in the lower-proficiency group, we analyzed sample passive 
sentences from a writer in this group, as presented in Table 5. Unlike the higher-proficiency learners, this writer does not demonstrate a 
significant differentiation in the use of passive voice between argumentative and narrative genres. The range of verbs employed in 
passive constructions is notably limited, and there are noticeable grammatical errors in both the formation of passives and the overall 
sentence structure, which are typical of lower-proficiency learners. Moreover, the strategic use of passive constructions to enhance 
rhetorical effect in argumentation or to emphasize an experiential focus in narration is less evident, falling short of increasing the 
persuasiveness of arguments or the vividness of narrative descriptions.

The primary objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of genre on the semantic cohesion of verbs within con­
structions in L2 writing, along with its potential interaction with L2 writing proficiency. By employing a semantic network analysis 
that focused on verbs within various constructions across argumentative and narrative genres, we found that each proficiency group 
exhibited distinct patterns in verb semantic networks across genres.
6.1. Summary of findings
In the higher proficiency group, there was a marked contrast between argumentative and narrative essays. Argumentative essays 
exhibited stronger semantic cohesion, characterized by denser and more interconnected verb networks. These networks included a

wide range of sophisticated verbs associated with analysis, judgment, and persuasion, reflecting the analytic characteristics of 
argumentative discourse. In contrast, narrative essays demonstrated lower semantic cohesion, with more streamlined networks 
featuring concrete actions and experiential verbs, consistent with the more straightforward and event-driven nature of storytelling.
Unlike the higher-proficiency group, the lower-proficiency group showed less pronounced differentiation between genres, relying 
on a more restricted range of verbs in both argumentative and narrative writing. Their verb semantic networks were simpler and less 
distinct between genres, suggesting a diminished ability to adapt verb usage to the specific rhetorical demands and objectives of each 
genre.
6.2. Theoretical implications
The distinct verb usage patterns across genres in the higher-proficiency group align with previous research on genre effects in L2 
writing (e.g., Lu, 2011; Qin & Uccelli, 2016; Renandya & Nguyen, 2023; Yoon, 2017; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). For 
example, Yoon and Polio (2017) found that L2 learners at a U.S. university used more complex syntactic structures in argumentative 
essays compared to narrative ones, particularly in terms of clause length, coordinate phrases, complex nominals, and verb phrases. The 
current study adds a new dimension to this line of research by extending the investigation of genre effects to verb semantic cohesion in 
writing. While previous studies have predominantly focused on syntactic and lexical complexity, relatively less attention has been paid 
to the semantic aspects of writing. In this regard, our study contributes to the field by highlighting the importance of semantic con­
siderations, particularly in relation to verb usage and semantic cohesion, thus offering a more comprehensive understanding of genre 
effects in L2 writing.
The differences in verb semantic cohesion between the two genres among the higher-proficiency group can be interpreted within 
the framework of Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2001, 2005). According to this hypothesis, increased task complexity 
leads to greater linguistic complexity and accuracy in language production. In line with this view, the higher-proficiency writers 
exhibited greater verb semantic cohesion in argumentative writing, which imposes greater task complexity compared to narrative 
writing. Specifically, argumentative writing requires multifaceted analytic processes, including logical reasoning, evidence evaluation, 
and persuasive rhetoric, rendering it a more cognitively complex task than narrative writing (Swales, 1990; Uccelli et al., 2013). Our 
findings of denser and more interconnected verb networks in the argumentative essays of higher-proficiency writers suggest that these 
learners effectively adjusted their writing style to meet the increased cognitive demands of the genre by employing more sophisticated 
language. This pattern also reflects their strategic use of verbs to enhance rhetorical effect and maintain an objective tone in

argumentation. These results indicate that higher-proficiency writers were not only capable of handling the cognitive complexity of 
argumentative writing but also demonstrated an awareness of the distinct linguistic features required for different communicative 
purposes in each genre, aligning with insights from genre-based studies (Biber & Conrad, 2009; Tardy, 2011).
Moreover, the modulation of proficiency is consistent with a usage-based perspective on language learning (Ellis, 2006, 2008; 
Goldberg, 1995, 1999; Tomasello, 2003). The more pronounced genre differentiation observed among higher proficiency writers likely 
reflects their greater exposure to and practice with a variety of text types. This finding aligns with the usage-based principle that 
language learning is fundamentally driven by the frequency and variability of input. Higher proficiency writers, having encountered a 
wider array of verbs and constructions across diverse examples of argumentative and narrative texts, have developed more distinct and 
sophisticated verb usage patterns appropriate for each genre. This genre-specific adaptation suggests their robust understanding of 
how verbs and constructions co-occur and function in different communicative contexts, reflecting a higher degree of entrenchment 
and abstraction of these linguistic patterns (Bybee, 2006).
In contrast, the less differentiated verb usage among the lower-proficiency group can be attributed to their less developed sensi­
tivity to verb–construction contingencies, presumably due to their more limited language experience. Furthermore, the less distinct 
semantic cohesion across genres indicates that these writers have not yet fully internalized the genre-specific conventions that guide 
the effective utilization of verbs and constructions in each genre. From a usage-based perspective, this finding aligns with the view that 
sensitivity to such contingencies develops gradually through repeated exposure and use in varied contexts (Tomasello, 2003). As these

writers gain more language experience, it is expected that they will develop a keener awareness of how verbs and constructions work 
together to convey meaning and achieve communicative goals in different genres. This progression should lead to more differentiated 
and complex verb semantic networks as their proficiency increases.
6.3. Pedagogical implications
The current findings have several implications for L2 writing instruction and assessment practices, particularly in evaluating the 
semantic aspects of writing. First, our results indicate that verb semantic analysis can supplement traditional assessment measures that 
focus on syntactic complexity and sophistication. By incorporating measures of semantic cohesion—specifically related to verb usage 
within constructions—educators can provide a more comprehensive and refined evaluation of a learner’s writing proficiency. Notably, 
our study introduces useful resources for the automatic analysis of verb semantic cohesion using NLP techniques, implemented 
through a Python script. This automated process allows for a fast and accurate assessment of students’ verb usage across different 
writing contexts, offering an efficient tool for educators to evaluate and monitor students’ writing progress in greater detail.
Second, the study highlights the importance of genre-specific evaluation in writing assessments (e.g., Yoon, 2017). We propose that 
writing assessments should explicitly measure a learner’s ability to adapt their verb usage to meet the distinct demands of various 
genres. For example, in argumentative essays, evaluators should assess the use of sophisticated verbs that convey analysis, judgment, 
and persuasion, ensuring these verbs are effectively embedded within relevant constructions to strengthen the arguments. In contrast, 
narrative writing should be assessed based on the effective use of action and experiential verbs that clearly describe events and 
experiences.
Third, the observed differences between proficiency groups suggest that genre-specific sensitivity to verb–construction contin­
gencies develops gradually along a continuum. This finding highlights the need for differentiated teaching approaches that align with 
students’ proficiency levels. For lower-proficiency students, for instance, instruction may begin by focusing on basic verbs that express 
the core meanings of the constructions in which they are used. As students become more comfortable with these prototypical patterns,

they can gradually be introduced to more complex verb–construction pairings and their appropriate use within specific genres. For 
advanced learners, instruction should incorporate exercises that challenge them to adjust their verb usage to meet the rhetorical 
demands of different genres. These activities can help foster a more sophisticated understanding of how verbs function within diverse 
communicative contexts. Such tailored instruction, which considers students’ current abilities, may ultimately enable them to make 
deliberate, genre-appropriate choices in their verb usage.
Alongside instruction, assessment practices should be refined to better capture this developmental progression. Educators could 
develop detailed rubrics that describe different levels of sensitivity to verb–construction contingencies, from basic use of common 
verbs to more sophisticated, genre-appropriate applications of a broad range of verbs within varied constructions. By implementing 
regular assessments that track students’ progress in developing these skills, teachers can more effectively guide learners through their 
long-term development. This approach will allow students to build a more contextually appropriate understanding of verb usage, 
gradually refining their ability to apply verbs strategically across different genres.
6.4. Limitations and suggestions for further research
We note several limitations that require further attention in future studies. First, a potential limitation stems from the presence of 
underdeveloped essays and grammatical errors in our corpus data. As is common in L2 writing research, we encountered several essays 
containing incomplete sentences and various linguistic inaccuracies. Given the lack of established conventions for handling such errors 
in semantic cohesion analysis, we chose to maintain the integrity of the original data, making only minor corrections for spelling errors 
in verbs. However, as noted by a reviewer, the inclusion of underdeveloped essays may have influenced our findings. This limitation 
points to the need for future research to develop standardized protocols for addressing incomplete or grammatically incorrect texts in 
semantic analyses of L2 writing.
Moreover, further studies should implement rigorous inter-rater reliability measures to ensure the consistency and validity of 
proficiency ratings. Although the essays in our dataset were evaluated by trained raters using CEFR rubrics as part of the corpus 
compilation process, no inter-rater agreement information was provided by the compilers. Incorporating multiple independent ratings 
for each essay would strengthen the reliability of these assessments, allowing for a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of 
proficiency.
Another limitation of our study is its limited scope. By focusing on only two genres and exclusively examining Korean L2 learners of 
English, the generalizability of our findings is somewhat restricted. To address this limitation, future research should consider a wider 
range of genres and include a more diverse sample of L2 learners from different L1 backgrounds, using a more fine-grained proficiency 
scale. These expansions would enhance the validity and generalizability of the results, offering deeper insights into how verb semantic 
cohesion manifests across different linguistic and cultural contexts in L2 writing.
7. Conclusion
This study investigated how genre and proficiency influence verb semantic cohesion in L2 writing, using NLP-based semantic 
network analysis of essays by Korean learners. Our findings have important implications for L2 writing instruction and assessment, 
suggesting that writing instruction should incorporate a focus on verb–construction contingencies, particularly within genre-based 
approaches. Additionally, the findings point to the need for more refined evaluation criteria in writing assessment that capture the 
complexity of verb usage and semantic cohesion across genres. To further generalize our findings, future research should examine 
whether the observed patterns apply to L2 production across various genres and learners with different L1 backgrounds.
